# Line Management Covenant

## Logistics

- 1-2 meeting can be held in person o r virtually via teams.
- 1-2-1s will be usually be scheduled fortnightly (probationary period or
  personal preference may mean this is more or less often. Details can be found
  in the [New Joiners Guidance](/guides/new-joiner)).
- 1-2-1s will be scheduled no less frequently than monthly.
- 1-2-1s can be scheduled via Lattice, in which you can add an agenda for the meet (see resources).
- 1-2-1s should usually last between 30 minutes and 1 hour.
- You are responsible for scheduling 1-2-1s. They should be scheduled to occur
  on a regular basis.

## Cancellations

- As much notice should be given if one of us needs to cancel a scheduled
  meeting. Where possible we will give at least 48 hours notice but it is
  accepted that there will be occasions where short notice cancellations are
  unavoidable.
- If one of us has to cancel a scheduled meeting, that person is responsible for
  rescheduling the meeting (if necessary).

## Notes

- You will keep your own notes and actions from any scheduled meetings. These can be added to the meeting in Lattice.
- Notes can be shared between 1-2-1 participants or kept private. 

## Commitments

### We commit to

- Being respectful of each others personal time.
- Holding any meetings, whether remote or face to face in a quiet place with as
  few distractions as possible. There may, however, be times when our meetings
  take place in a public place.

### I commit to

- Giving honest, timely and objective feedback.
- Keeping you informed of any non-confidential information that is relevant to
  your role.
- Being as available as possible outside of any scheduled 1-2-1.
- Keeping anything you do not wish to be disclosed confidential as long as it
  isn't affecting your work or is in breach of your employment contract.

### You commit to

- Raise any issues/problems that I can help with at the earliest possible
  opportunity.
